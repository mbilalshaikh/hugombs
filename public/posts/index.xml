      <description>In this I will follow my preffered briefing method the WHAC method.
What?    Compressed video formats produced different modalities which includes i-frames, p-frames, b-frames and audio. A recent beautiful work from CVPR 2022, produced four transformer-based architectures to fuse these four modalities in an interesting way.
Using the base Vit and ViViT models, MM-ViT scored better or equally nearby scores on UCF101, Kinetics 600 and SomethingSomethingv2 (without audio dataset).</description>

      <description>Daily Azkar means the zikr that I should do on daily basis.
 First one is after fajar prayer.   After each prayer 33xSubhan Allah, 33xAlhamdulillah,34xAllah o Akbar.
  For increase in knowledge.
  A very powerful daily tasbeeh is 100 times Subhanallahi Wa bi hamdihi. Surah e Ikhlas equals one-third of Quran. Durood e Ibrahimi  </description>

      <description>Today I woke up early around 6:30 and after morning prayers, I left for my much needed hike at King&amp;rsquo;s Park.
I arrived on time and met Damien, Peggy, Fred, a kenyan(don&amp;rsquo;t know the name) and Tim.
This route of the hike had downstream-ladders, a portion to hike uphill. walk across the bushes, passing nearby river, a beautiful paranomic view of Elizabeth Quay and Swan river. I felt quite after this hike.</description>

      <description>Hi today, I want to talk about my interaction with hugo coder theme. I recently came across linkedin profile of a specialist data engineer, who is also instructor for some bootcamps and speaker at data related events. On his linkedin, he mentioned certain technologies which he uses for creating world class data architectures.
For everything, he shared his professional website url. I liked this idea of having a separate page on the web where you can simply talk about what you can offer.</description>
