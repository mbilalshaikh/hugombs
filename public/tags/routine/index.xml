      <description>I follow two calendars since my childhood. (1) modern day solar calendar (gregorian) and (2) the lunar islamic calendar.
They have commonalities such they both are divided into 12 months although months have different days limit. For example, Moharram the first islamic month will have two fortnights which equals 28 days while the first the gregorian month january will have 31 days. This inequality increases the date difference of almost 12 days each year.</description>

      <description>Daily Azkar means the zikr that I should do on daily basis.
 First one is after fajar prayer.   After each prayer 33xSubhan Allah, 33xAlhamdulillah,34xAllah o Akbar.
  For increase in knowledge.
  A very powerful daily tasbeeh is 100 times Subhanallahi Wa bi hamdihi. Surah e Ikhlas equals one-third of Quran. Durood e Ibrahimi  </description>

      <description>Yes a friday.
I wake up goto office. around juma prayer time i goto to prayer at mosque. i come back i spend time in office. i go back to asar maghrib isha i goto to home for dinner and sleep.
Technically, I should wake up at Fajar recite Surah e Yaseen, do ghusl, off to office then before juma prayer, I should recite Surah e Kahaf and then Juma prayer, return back to office and then off around Asar and Maghrib prayer.</description>
