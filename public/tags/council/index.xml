      <description>Today I woke up early around 6:30 and after morning prayers, I left for my much needed hike at King&amp;rsquo;s Park.
I arrived on time and met Damien, Peggy, Fred, a kenyan(don&amp;rsquo;t know the name) and Tim.
This route of the hike had downstream-ladders, a portion to hike uphill. walk across the bushes, passing nearby river, a beautiful paranomic view of Elizabeth Quay and Swan river. I felt quite after this hike.</description>
