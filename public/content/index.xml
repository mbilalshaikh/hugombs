      <description>Daily Azkar means the zikr that I should do on daily basis.
 First one is after fajar prayer.   After each prayer 33xSubhan Allah, 33xAlhamdulillah,34xAllah o Akbar.
  For increase in knowledge.
  A very powerful daily tasbeeh is 100 times Subhanallahi Wa bi hamdihi. Surah e Ikhlas equals one-third of Quran. Durood e Ibrahimi  </description>

I have to work 16 hours every fortnight for which there is some honorarium for me. I am also a senator which is by default if you are leading one of the business units, you become part of the senate.</description>

      <description>Hi today, I want to talk about my interaction with hugo coder theme. I recently came across linkedin profile of a specialist data engineer, who is also instructor for some bootcamps and speaker at data related events. On his linkedin, he mentioned certain technologies which he uses for creating world class data architectures.
For everything, he shared his professional website url. I liked this idea of having a separate page on the web where you can simply talk about what you can offer.</description>
