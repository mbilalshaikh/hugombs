Yes a friday. 

I wake up goto office. around juma prayer time i goto to prayer at mosque. i come back i spend time in office. i go back to asar maghrib isha i goto to home for dinner and sleep.

Technically, I should wake up at Fajar recite Surah e Yaseen, do ghusl, off to office then before juma prayer, I should recite Surah e Kahaf and then Juma prayer, return back to office and then off around Asar and Maghrib prayer.
