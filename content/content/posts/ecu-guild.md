Hi today, I want to talk about my interaction with hugo coder theme. I recently came across linkedin profile of a specialist data engineer, who is also instructor for some bootcamps and speaker at data related events. On his linkedin, he mentioned certain technologies which he uses for creating world class data architectures. 

For everything, he shared his professional website url. I liked this idea of having a separate page on the web where you can simply talk about what you can offer. You skills, projects and the daily routine things which you do. 

So I checked the copyrights, which led me to Hugo quickstart and I developed my own website in some ten minutes on Mac straight away. I loved it. The sleekness and deceny of the standard ui, just makes me feel it.
