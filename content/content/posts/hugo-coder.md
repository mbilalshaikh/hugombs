ECU Guild is separate not for profit organization at my university. I currently work there is a head of postgraduate department who has 16 school reps from each school of ECU. I have to work 16 hours every fortnight for which there is some honorarium for me. I am also a senator which is by default if you are leading one of the business units, you become part of the senate. 

I am also the member of several committees that are interacting with ECU Guild for bringing student representation in the mainstream. These committees are: 

* Education Committee
* Higher Degree Research (HDR) Committee
* ECU Guild Senate Committee
* GSA Senate Committee
* Academic Board 

My department at ECU Guild also organizes certain events such as annual dinner for postgraduates, breakfast for engineering PGs, lunch for school of science PGs and we sponsored some PGs to attend a local event here in Perth.
