I follow two calendars since my childhood. (1) modern day solar calendar (gregorian) and (2) the lunar islamic calendar.

They have commonalities such they both are divided into 12 months although months have different days limit. For example, Moharram the first islamic month will have two fortnights which equals 28 days while the first the gregorian month january will have 31 days. This inequality increases the date difference of almost 12 days each year. 

Both calendars have some special days throughout the calendars which increases my scope of attention for both calendars. I will try to list them as this was the primary motivation for this article. I will add level of importance to their existance which is subjective.
