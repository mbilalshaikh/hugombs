Today I woke up early around 6:30 and after morning prayers, I left for my much needed hike at King's Park. 

I arrived on time and met Damien, Peggy, Fred, a kenyan(don't know the name) and Tim.

This route of the hike had downstream-ladders, a portion to hike uphill. walk across the bushes, passing nearby river, a beautiful paranomic view
of Elizabeth Quay and Swan river. I felt quite after this hike. 
At the moment, I want to join the next week's hike which is near South Perth, may be it time and health permitted. 

I avoided taking away pictures and focused more than on doing the hike well. 
It was a good start to the week overall.
